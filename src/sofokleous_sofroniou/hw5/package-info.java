/**
 * In this package there are six classes. The first class, Point, is a
 * representation of a position with the coordinates x,y. The second class,
 * People, is a representation of a person. Third class, Cell, is a
 * representation of a cell in a grid, a position of a human in a grid. Forth
 * class, Grid, is a representation of our simulation with a grid and people.
 * Fifth class, DrawGrid, is a class that draws our simulation. And the sixth
 * class, Covid, is the driver class of our simulation. In this simulation, we
 * create people and infect some of them with the virus. Then we monitor their
 * health using a visual representation. At the end we show the end statistics
 * of the simulation.
